# A. David Jackson - Portfolio
Hi, Iâ€™m David Jackson, a data analyst and researcher with a background in political science and quantitative methods. I use Python, R, stata and statistical modeling to turn complex data into clear, actionable insights.  

### Projects
### [Vote Choice and Personal Characteristics Analysis](https://github.com/antonycj/Candidate-Perception-and-Vote-Choice/)
- Built **logistic regression** and **predictive probability** models using ANES survey data (2016â€“2024).  
- Analyzed how votersâ€™ perceptions of candidate traits like honesty and leadership affect vote choice.  
- Conducted **data cleaning, visualization, and model interpretation** in R (`tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `broom`).  
- Created a polished report and visual dashboard summarizing insights.  

   
### [Roll Call Vote Textual Extraction and Mapping](https://github.com/antonycj/Roll-Call-Vote-Extraction-and-Analysis) 
- Used **Python (Regex, Pandas)** to extract and structure roll call vote data from archival legislative records.  
- Transformed text into analyzable quantitative data and visualized ideological clusters via **PCA and W-NOMINATE**.  
- Demonstrated strong skills in **data wrangling, automation, and cross-language analysis** (Python + R).
